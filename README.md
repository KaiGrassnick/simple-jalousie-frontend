# Simple Frontend for ES8266 Jalousie-Control

This is a dirty and fast approach to control the living-room jalousie.
It's supposed to be replaced by the SimpleSmartHome Project.
Since this will take a while, i made this dirty fast solution with pretty much no effort, till it can be replaced.

*NOTE:* Since the ESP8266 Spiffs filesystem does not support folders, the path's to the css / js files inside the index.html needs to be changed for development.
